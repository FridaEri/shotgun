# shotgun

This is a first assignment for my .net program. It's a console shotgun game.
The task was to create a game called Shotgun.

I built a program where the user plays Shotgun against the computer.
The computer player chooses its move randomly.
Shotgun is somewhat similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors, but it allows the player to choose between "Shoot", "Load", and "Block".
To win a round, you must shoot while your opponent is not choosing Block or Shoot at the same time.
Each player starts with no bullets, and to get more bullets you must Load.
Every time you load, you gain one bullet.
If both players choose Shoot, they both lose one bullet, but no one wins the round.
When a player has collected three bullets, they can use "Shotgun", which wins automatically, even if the opponent chooses Block or Shoot.
